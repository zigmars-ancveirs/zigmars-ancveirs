## Hi — I’m Zigmārs Ancveirs

Founder of **FINULIO** — market observability for consumer finance: data, methodology, corrections-first & transparency verification signals. 20+ years across web platforms, APIs, data pipelines, and cloud/edge operations — with a security & privacy-by-design mindset.

### What I build
- Comparable consumer-finance data with clear disclosures and traceability/provenance (versioned evidence trail)
- Monitoring & change detection (freshness, deltas, anomalies)
- Trust tooling: corrections workflow, transparent methodology, security posture signals

### Strengths
- Full-stack engineering (web + APIs)
- Data engineering (extraction, validation, versioned contracts)
- Security & privacy by design (threat modeling, readiness reviews — non-certification)
- Cloud/edge architecture and reliable delivery
- Languages: Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP

### B2B/B2G collaboration (selected)
Selected B2B/B2G collaboration: monitoring datasets & APIs, plus security & privacy readiness (high-level) and usability reviews — when aligned with the mission.
