## Hi — I’m Zigmārs Ancveirs

Founder-led engineer building evidence-first systems for high-trust domains (fintech, data, security).  
**20+ years** in software engineering. **Fintech since 2008** (comparison platforms, credit-data ecosystem / credit-information bureau operations).

I care about: **traceability**, **reproducibility**, **privacy-by-design**, and **boring reliability**.

### What I work on
- Market observability: snapshots → diffs → change signals (freshness, deltas, anomalies)
- Data contracts & provenance: versioned schemas, compatibility rules, reproducible outputs
- Trust tooling: corrections workflow, transparent methodology, verification signals
- Security & privacy engineering: threat modeling, least-PII architectures, evidence-driven readiness reviews (non-certification)

### How I work (defaults)
- Evidence-first: sources, snapshots, diffs, provenance — no “hand-wavy” claims
- Contracts-first: JSON Schema / OpenAPI, versioning & compatibility discipline
- Monitoring-first: freshness/anomalies are product features, not afterthoughts
- Security & privacy-by-design: least-privilege, minimal data collection, clear threat model
- Efficiency-first: lean delivery, minimal compute; measurable impact only where reporting exists (no “carbon neutral” claims)

### Strengths
- Full-stack engineering (web + APIs)
- Data engineering (extraction, validation, versioned contracts)
- Cloud/edge architecture & reliable delivery (observability, CI/CD, performance)
- Languages: Go, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Dart, PHP

### Collaboration
Open to selected collaborations:
- Hardening web/API & data systems
- Monitoring & change detection pipelines (freshness/delta/anomaly)
- AI-assisted automation with guardrails (strict schemas + validation)

Available for high-level, evidence-driven reviews:
- Data quality & provenance
- Security/privacy readiness (signals-based, non-certification)
- Usability/clarity for trust-heavy products
