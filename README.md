## Hi — I’m Zigmārs Ancveirs

Founder-led **Finulio**: market observability for consumer finance — comparable data, transparent methodology, corrections-first, and verification signals.

**20+ years** building web + data systems. **Fintech since 2008** (comparison platforms, credit-data ecosystem, credit-information bureau operations).
Security & privacy by design.

### What I build
- Comparable consumer-finance datasets with clear disclosures and traceable provenance (versioned evidence trail)
- Monitoring & change detection: freshness, deltas, and anomaly signals
- Trust tooling: corrections workflow, methodology, and transparency/security posture signals

### Operating principles (defaults)
- Evidence-first: snapshots, diffs, provenance, reproducible outputs
- Contracts-first: JSON Schema + OpenAPI, versioning & compatibility rules
- Monitoring-first: freshness/anomalies are product features, not afterthoughts
- Security & privacy by design: threat modeling, least-PII, evidence-driven readiness reviews (non-certification)
- Efficiency-first: lean delivery, minimal compute, measurable impact only where reporting exists (no “carbon neutral” claims)

### What Finulio is *not*
- Not a lender, not a broker, not a lead-gen marketplace
- No “application funnels”, no hidden profiling — publisher-only by design

### Focus areas for collaboration
Selected engineering collaborations:
- Hardening web/API + data pipelines
- Monitoring & change detection (freshness, deltas, anomaly detection)
- AI-assisted automation with guardrails (strict schemas + validation)

Also available for high-level, evidence-driven reviews:
- Data quality & provenance
- Security/privacy readiness (signals-based, non-certification)
- Usability/clarity in high-trust domains
